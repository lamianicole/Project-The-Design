    <h2>Every idea <span>üí°</span>starts with a
        need</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
        my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
        some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
        phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
        sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
        made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
        the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
    </div>

<h2>After several weeks of sticking to this
    challenge, I learned a lot</h2>

        <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
        <p>You will start seeing things differently and
            coming up with more effective ways of achieving
            goals.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h3>Your ideas will have more value</h3>
        <p>By looking at problems from a different
            perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more
            valuable.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h3>Design solutions with love</h3>
        <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do
            you understand the frustration of the users and
            resolve to end it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <h3>Share and show your work</h3>
        <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing
            work that‚Äôs not finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect.
            You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
            it.</p>

    <h5>Are you ready? Let‚Äôs go!!</h5>
    <p>The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have
        to create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and
        show the result to the community.</p>
